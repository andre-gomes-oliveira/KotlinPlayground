# Kotlin Playground
A playground to experiment, test and learn the intricacies of Kotlin development.

## Greetings
A slightly smarter "Hello World" test, which takes the arguments passed to the main function and decides between day and night greetings

## DayOfWeek
Contains a function that tells what day of the week it is. Testing the following Kotlin concepts:

* Immutable variables (val)
* Muttable variavles (var)
* String template
* The *repeat* function
* The *while* loop

## FortuneCookies

The fortuneCookies function gives different fortunes depending on the date of birth of the . Testing the following Kotlin concepts:
* The *When* expression 
* Calling functions straight from primitive type variables
* The null safety and the elvis operators

## WhatShouldIDo

This contains tests of a few more exclusive function concepts in Kotlin

* Compact functions
* Using named parameters to pass them out of order to a function
* The null safety and the elvis operators

## Filters101

A few tests on how to use *filters* on lists, including

* Basic filtering using a simple value
* Filtering using two values simultaneously
* Filtering and then sorting, alphabetically and by length
* Filtering only a subset of the list

## Lambdas101

A few tests using *lambdas* in Kotlin, showing off a few neat things

* Assigning *lambdas* to variables and calling them
* Assigning *lambdas* that take a parameter and calling them
* Using input from the user to assign *lambda* parameters
* Type inference
* Using higher order functions
